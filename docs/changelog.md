## v4.0.0b1 🌈

### Breaking Changes

This version is a full revamp of the package. The main changes are related to removing the RQ dependency.
Worker/Queue/Job are all implemented in the package itself. This change allows for more flexibility and control over
the tasks.

Management commands:

- `rqstats` => `scheduler_stats`
- `rqworker` => `scheduler_worker`

Settings:

- `SCHEDULER_CONFIG` is now a `SchedulerConfiguration` object to help IDE guide settings.
- `SCHEDULER_QUEUES` is now a list of `QueueConfiguration` objects to help IDE guide settings.
- Configuring queue to use `SSL`/`SSL_CERT_REQS`/`SOCKET_TIMEOUT` is now done using `CONNECTION_KWARGS` in
  `QueueConfiguration`
  ```python
  SCHEDULER_QUEUES: Dict[str, QueueConfiguration] = {
    'default': QueueConfiguration(
        HOST='localhost',
        PORT=6379,
        USERNAME='some-user',
        PASSWORD='some-password',
        CONNECTION_KWARGS={  # Eventual additional Broker connection arguments
            'ssl_cert_reqs': 'required',
            'ssl':True,
        },
    ),
   # ...
   }
   ```
